# CookorDie

Project 2 for UT Coding Bootcamp.

Concept: 

Most food budgeting apps are tedious and clunky. They usually involve a lot of work from the users which include manually plugging in ingredients. Cook or Die is a food app that uses a clean picture oriented interface that takes the work out of logging in ingredients. It comes with a preestablished list of ingredients represented by pictures. Simply click on a picture to log what is in your inventory. 

Once you have your inventory logged out you can get recipes based on your inventory.

Plan in advance, budget and reduce food waste all with Cook or Die! 

** Next stages is allowing users to be able to take a picture and include it in the database.
